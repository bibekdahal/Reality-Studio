# Reality-Studio

Game creation software with drag-and-drop features created with custom game-engine based on DirectX

This one is a very old project. The directx based game engine (bdGameEngine.dll) was developed in C++.

The game engine itself is very unoptimized and buggy, but this was one of the first projects that led me into the field of core game engine development.

The studio itself is created in VB.net (I was young and innocent) and supports:

- Adding animated and non-animated 3d meshes (.X files)
- Adding new objects and adding VB scripts to them
- Syntax highlighting for VB scripts
- Adding instances of objects to "levels"
- Adding VB scripts to levels themselves
- Adding global VB scripts
